# Video-material-for-manuscripts-submitted-by-CAEE
The repository is used for CAEE submissions, in which four experimental videos are provided, a video of the drone performing slow unsynchronized and fast synchronized reconfigurations in hover, and a video of the drone flying in an asymmetric form. Finally we also manually controlled the UAV to traverse a narrow channel.
